Strelnokoff
===========

This is the reference distribution for Strelnokoff, an esoteric programming
language which is both imperative and non-deterministic.

There is no formal documentation to speak of as of yet, but if there ever
will be, it will be found in the `doc` subdirectory.

This distribution also contains an interpreter for Strelnokoff, written in
Perl, as `strelnokoff` in the `script` directory, and some example
Strelnokoff programs in the `eg` directory.

This distribution is BSD-license-compatible; see the file LICENSE for
detailed licensing information.
